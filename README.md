## Reflection
It was a great experience to perform test analysis using R Studio. This project provided a comprehensive understanding of the multifaceted factors influencing life expectancy. It highlighted the importance of a holistic approach to health, incorporating immunization, economic development, social equity, and targeted health interventions. The findings reinforced the need for countries to invest in healthcare infrastructure, education, and equitable economic policies to improve life expectancy and overall public health. Compared to the previous project, of course the workload is greater as this is an individual project whereas project 1 was a group project, but I can do my research, findings and analysis freely. Working on this project enhanced my skills in statistical analysis. It also underscored the value of interdisciplinary approaches in addressing complex health issues. The insights gained from this project can inform policy-making and strategic planning aimed at improving global health outcomes. Throughout the project, I found out some interesting statements from my analysis. I am surprised to actually found out that our conclusion from the analysis is related to our real world. In conclusion, this project demonstrated the power of data-driven analysis in uncovering critical health determinants. It provided actionable insights that can guide efforts to enhance life expectancy and quality of life across different populations. I believed that this project will be very useful for my future in the computer science field. Thank you!
